# speakerphone.io
<h3> Brief Synopsis </h3>
An app that builds a community around audio content. Users would be able to upload, listen to, and share any audio with other users. The differentiator will be that users can purchase (using bitcoin or some other token) audio files from other users in order to stream or own the audio. The idea being that whenever a user makes a purchase from another user, that audio file is then loaded into what ever storage they are using and they always have access to the file.

<h3>Technology Used</h3>
Blockstack will be used on the three layers it will have the most impact: Identity, storage, and payments. The identity layer will be used to authorize a user to the app so they can access their audio. The storage layer will be where all the audio files of a user are kept and that they should be able to access at anytime. Finally, the payments layer will be used for transactions and exchange. For example, when user A pays user B to listen to access a particular audio file, once the transaction has completed, the audio file will be moved to the paying customers storage where it can accessed and listened to whenever they are logged in to the app. The following tech will be considered:

<ul>
<ol>Node.js</ol>
<ol>Vue.js</ol>
<ol>React.js</ol>
<ol>wavesurfer.js</ol>
</ul>
